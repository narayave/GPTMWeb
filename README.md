## Changes / Comments##
1. The banner might eventually change. Other thought is we can change the general theme of the website. Helpful link is http://www.lavishbootstrap.com/.
2. We need to have carousels for ads, based on the type. It's our job to try to figure out where that goes.


##Changes for "About" page when there is a new committee 
1. In the navbar, make sure current and previous committees are appropriate.
2. In the About page itself, the committee positions need to be modified.
3. On the bottom of the About page, the "Older" navigation button takes the user to the previous committee bios, this needs to be changed to the current committee.
4. In previous committee pages, make sure to fix the page header.

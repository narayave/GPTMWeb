			<h1>Our Mission</h1>
			<p>
				GPTM is a non-profit organization for the Tamil speaking populace of the Portland metropolitan area, including the Portland suburbs 
				and Vancouver, Washington. Our mission is to pass on and promote the rich cultural and linguistic heritage of Tamils among the local Tamil population. We strive to provide an opportunity for the people to come together, share and celebrate tamil arts, culture and traditions, and get entertained with the Tamil cultural programs. As part of this effort, we organize atleast 3 events annually: Pongal festiva (representing the harvest season) in January/February, Tamil New Year festival in April/May, and Deepavali (festival of Lights) in October/November. The programs have included inviting artists from India and all over the US in addition to encouraging our local talent.
